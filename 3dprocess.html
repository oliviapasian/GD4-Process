                <h2>Idea Development</h2>
                <p>
                    I struggled a lot to come up with an idea for this assignment because I pushed it back and did it last. My initial idea for this assignment was to do something related to the "imaginary" aspect of my word. One definition of amaranth is an "imaginary, never-dying flower", and I thought doing something with AR technology (adding a virtual image to the real world). In class discussions, one idea offered to me was to do a kind of survey to ask people to draw a flower from their imagination and look for commone elements. I thought I might make a kind of interactive AR sticker using these drawings, to play on the idea of it being flowers from people's imagination and also an "imaginary"/not real image by using AR. I collected some flower images from people I asked, but I wasn't very excited about my idea and I wasn't sure how I wanted it to look. I went back to research and thought about how I always kill plants, and how it would be cool to have a kind of Tamagotchi-like simulator where you can take care of a digital plant. But I realized pretty fast that trying to code something like that in the 3D style I wanted to do would take longer than I had. I really liked the idea though, but I still really liked the idea of using AR, so I combined the two and ended up with the idea of making a never-dying imaginary flower that you can put anywhere in your room using Adobe Aero. I wanted to create context for the flower itself so I decided to make a poster to host the scannable QR code to access the flower image, and on the poster I thought I'd add some kind of hook to explain the idea of it being made for people who always kill flowers.

                <h2>3D Model Process</h2>
                <p>
                    Once I had my idea, I was super excited to start but I had no idea how to execute it. I have never done anything with 3D modelling and I knew that I wanted my AR flower to be 3D so you could rotate the camera around it to see all the angles. I initially wanted to use Adobe Dimension and Adobe's other 3D modelling programs, but they had a ton of technical issues. None of the base shapes (ex. cubes, cylinders) were able to be used, it kept saying there was an error. I also tried Adobe Illustrator's 3D tools, but wasn't a fan. The Adobe programs kept crashing as well, so I researched the free tool Blender which I had heard of people using. Blender seems to be pretty popular so I decided to try downloading it, and it was actually really well-designed. I didn't watch any tutorials at first so it took some practice, but constructing and sculpting my flower model was fairly simple, just time-consuming. Originally I thought it might be nice to make 3ish models and be able to choose which flower to place in your room, but I learned quickly how difficult it could be to construct the 3D model. I spent a bunch of time on the one model and knew I couldn't make two more. So I decided to model my flower after the amaranth flower, maybe a little too literal to the meaning of my word but I thought it was fitting. I originally wanted the model to be realistic, but I struggled to shape simple cylinders so I decided to do something more sculptural and stylized.

                    The next problem I had was colouring the model. I could not figure out why Blender would crash whenever I tried to add colour, so I finally pulled up some tutorials and learned you have to flatten the model into a 2D version (UV Unwrapping). Finally I could paint on colour! I wasn't sure how to add texture, so I moved the model into Adobe Dimension, which was a struggle in itself to figure out the right file types. In Dimension, I added the shine on the flower pot. From there, it was really easy to export to Adobe Aero, where I could adjust the scale and export the model as a scannable QR code.

              <h2>Poster Process</h2>
              <p>
                  In my research, I came across <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/eckmannpsych">this font</a> which I thought was really interesting. I thought the kind of psychedelic style was cool and not something I had worked with before. Since the whole idea was to make an imaginary 3D experience, I thought that psyechelic style was fitting. Plus I love using bright colours so I really just ran with the idea. I also wanted to add a lot of cut out shapes to make a kind of stenciled feel, I didn't have as much of a conceptual reason so much as I thought it was a good look for the design. I went through a few different poster design changes to get to the end, as shown in the images below.

                <h2>Final AR Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    After finishing my poster and adding my 3D model into Adobe Aero, I was almost done. In Adobe Aero, I added a small animation where if you tap on the flower, it'll jump and spin. Nothing too exciting, but adds a nice little bit of interactivity. I exported a QR code from Aero to link to the AR experience and brought that into Photoshop to match my poster. I placed it on the poster and printed it to be ready to present!
