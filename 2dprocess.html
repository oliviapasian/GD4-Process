                <p>
                    I first used Procreate, my preferred digital drawing tool, to draft these bases for my seed packets, based on previous colour ideas and sketches. I was not happy with the colours at this stage and they needed some overall refinement, which I decided to do in Photoshop so I could see it on a larger screen and have access to more editing tools than continuing to work in Procreate.

                <p>
                    I added text and created a template for my base using InDesign. For my first print, I used a glossy but fairly thin paper, and the colours turned out pretty well but I found that the paper was kind of frail and the construction wasn't great; the paper was tearing in some places and it wasn't securely put together. I resolved to print it again on different paper to try adn fix these issues.

                <p>
                    For my final seed packet, I adjusted the way my template folded to add some more plant info. The new print turned out a lot better in my opinion, the construction was much improved and I think the paper weight feels a lot better, it's sturdy. The colours unfortunately turned out a bit dull, but it was a bit of a happy accident because I think that it looks more natural and suitable for a seed packet.
